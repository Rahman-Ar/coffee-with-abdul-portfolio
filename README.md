# ☕ Coffee With Abdul – My Portfolio

Hey! I’m Abdul, and this is my little corner of the internet where I show off what I’m building.  
This portfolio is made with **React**, and yes — I put it online using **Netlify**, so you can poke around live: [Check it out](https://coffeewithabdul.netlify.app/)

## 📸 A Sneak Peek

Here’s a quick look at what you’ll see:

🏠 ![Homepage](./assets/homepage.png)  
*The homepage — clean, simple, and hopefully not too boring 😅*

💻 ![Skills Section](./assets/skills.png)  
*Where I brag about the stuff I know. React, CSS, a little JS magic…*

🗂️ ![Projects Section](./assets/projects.png)  
*Some of my experiments and side projects. Not all are perfect, but hey, that’s how you learn!*

## ✨ What’s in Here

- A **modern design** that doesn’t break on your phone  
- **Projects section** so you know I actually do stuff  
- **Skills section** to show what I’ve learned (and still learning!)  
- **Contact section** in case you want to say hi or roast my code 😎  
- **React all the way**, because I love components and hate spaghetti code  
- Deployed on **Netlify**, because I want it to be seen  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

- React (duh!)  
- CSS  
- Git & GitHub (saving my own life every day)  
- Netlify (makes it live with zero headaches)  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this wasn’t all smooth. But I learned:

- How to structure a React app without crying  
- Managing props and components like a semi-pro  
- Using Git/GitHub without breaking everything  
- Deploying to Netlify (finally something online!)

I’m still learning, so feedback is gold.
