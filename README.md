# ☕ Coffee With Abdul – My Portfolio

Hey! I’m Abdul, and this is my little corner of the internet where I show off what I’m building.  
This portfolio is made with **React**, and yes — I put it online using **Netlify**, so you can poke around live: [Check it out](https://coffeewithabdul.netlify.app/)

## 📸 A Sneak Peek

Here’s a quick look at what you’ll see:

*The homepage — clean, simple, and hopefully not too boring 😅*

*Where I brag about the stuff I know. React, CSS, a little JS magic…*

*Some of my experiments and side projects. Not all are perfect, but hey, that’s how you learn!*

## About This Portfolio

I built this site to show what I’ve been working on and what I’m learning. Everything is made with React because I really love components and hate messy code. It’s fully responsive, so whether you’re on a phone, tablet, or desktop, it should work just fine. I also wanted it online, so Netlify made that part super easy.

While building it, I learned a lot. I figured out how to structure a React app without losing my mind, how to manage props and components like a semi-pro, and finally how to deploy something online that actually works. Git and GitHub saved me more than once, too.
